# De-Bruijn-Graph-Assembly

Genome assembly refers to the process of putting nucleotide sequence into the correct order. Genome assembly refers to the process of putting nucleotide sequence into the correct
order. 
Sequence assembly can be done using one of three approaches:
* greedy
* overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) and Hamiltonian path
* de Bruijn graph and Eulerian path.

Here we use de Bruijn graph and Eulerian path for the string reconstruction.
